                The winning time in the open women’s category was 6:55.9, belonging to Gabriela Thomas of Vesper Boat Club. Thomas had a nearly 15-second lead ahead of second place Kelsey Barolak from Riverside Boat Club. Fellow clubmate Annalise Routenberg finished in third.

                In the open men’s category, Marqus Brown finished in the top time of 6:00.7. Brown had a narrow lead over two more athletes from Riverside Boat Club, Nathan Whitaker and Bill Tomlinson, who finished in second and third respectively.

                The event with the largest number of entries was the junior men’s (under-19) category with 152. The large numbers must have helped spur the athletes on as one of the fastest times from the entire day was recorded when Isaiah Harrison claimed gold in 5:53.2. Harrison currently holds under-17 world record and his top finish over the weekend broke the United States’ under-19 record. In second place was Savas Koutsouras with a time of 6:07.2 and in third, Mack Carr with 6:13.3.
